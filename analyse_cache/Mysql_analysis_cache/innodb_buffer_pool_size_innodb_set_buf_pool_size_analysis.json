  "analysis": "1. Parameters influence database performance by controlling key functions:\n   - innodb_buffer_pool_size affects innodb_set_buf_pool_size by \"controlling the size of memory allocated to the InnoDB buffer pool,\" thereby \"impacting data caching efficiency and memory utilization.\"\n   - Mechanism: When the value of innodb_buffer_pool_size increases, innodb_set_buf_pool_size will set a larger buffer pool (srv_buf_pool_curr_size), improving data cache hit rate and reducing disk I/O operations.\n   - Database performance impact: Increasing innodb_buffer_pool_size can enhance the effectiveness of memory caching, reduce the number of disk reads when accessing tables, and thus improve database query speed and overall performance.\n\n2. Based on the execution status of innodb_set_buf_pool_size and related function segments, provide optimization suggestions for innodb_buffer_pool_size:\n   - If other functions are involved, please indicate whether it is necessary to monitor other functions besides innodb_set_buf_pool_size.\n   - Yes, it is necessary to monitor the actual usage of srv_buf_pool_curr_size to ensure the buffer pool size is reasonably configured, and pay attention to other parameters that may affect memory performance, such as innodb_log_file_size.\n   - How to recommend the direction and basis for adjusting innodb_buffer_pool_size based on the flame graph sampling rate of innodb_set_buf_pool_size and other functions:\n     - By sampling and analyzing the usage rate of the buffer pool size, if monitoring reveals that innodb_buffer_pool_size is relatively low while the buffer pool usage rate is consistently near or at capacity, it is recommended to increase innodb_buffer_pool_size to reduce disk I/O and improve performance.\n     - If monitoring shows that the buffer pool is frequently underutilized, consider reducing innodb_buffer_pool_size to optimize memory resource usage and save system resources.",
